Therefore<span class="highlight">,</span> I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the <span class="highlight">question mark (?).</span>  Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun<span class="highlight">,</span> just an unnecessary name of something<span class="highlight">.</span> A question is a question<span class="highlight">,</span> anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing<span class="highlight">?</span> Therefore<span class="highlight">,</span> <span class="highlight">"</span>I never could bring myself to use a <span class="highlight">question mark (?),</span>  I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it<span class="highlight">."</span> <span class="highlight">Exclamation marks (!)</span>have the same difficulty and also <span class="highlight">quotation marks (" " / ' ' ),</span> they are <span class="highlight">"unnecessary!!!"",</span> they are <span class="highlight">"ugly!!!"",</span>  they <span class="highlight">'spoil'</span> the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use<span class="highlight">,</span> if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question<span class="highlight">.</span> The same thing is true of a <span class="highlight">quotation marks (" " / ' ' ).</span> When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use <span class="highlight">question marks (?) & quotation marks (" " / ' ' ) & exclamation points (!) ,</span> and now anybody sees it that way<span class="highlight">!</span> Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way<span class="highlight">.</span>

          When I first began writing<span class="highlight">,</span> I felt that writing should go on<span class="highlight">,</span> I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the <span class="highlight">'necessity'</span> that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had <span class="highlight">colons (:) & commas (,)</span> to do with it<span class="highlight">,</span> what had <span class="highlight">periods(.)</span> to do with it what had <span class="highlight">small letters (abc)</span> and <span class="highlight">capitals (ABC)</span> to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing<span class="highlight">.</span> What had <span class="highlight">colons (:) & semi-colons (;)</span> to do with it what had <span class="highlight">commas (,)</span> do with it what had periods to do with it<span class="highlight">.</span>

          What had <span class="highlight">periods (.)</span> to do with it<span class="highlight">.</span> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on<span class="highlight">,</span> physically one had to again <span class="highlight">&</span> again stop sometime<span class="highlight">, and</span>  if one had to again <span class="highlight">&</span> again stop sometime and if one had to again <span class="highlight"> & </span>again stop some time then <span class="highlight">periods (.)</span> had to exist. Beside I had always like the look of <span class="highlight">periods (.), and</span> I liked what they did<span class="highlight">.</span> Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered<span class="highlight">,</span> it was only something that happened<span class="highlight">,</span> and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening<span class="highlight">,</span> I did not believe in <span class="highlight">periods (.), and</span> I used them<span class="highlight">.</span> I really never stopped using them<span class="highlight">.</span>

          Beside that<span class="highlight">, periods (.)</span> might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways<span class="highlight">,</span> that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way<span class="highlight">,</span> later I will read you a little of it<span class="highlight">.</span> By the time I had written this poem about three years ago <span class="highlight">periods (.),</span> had come to have for me completely a life of their own<span class="highlight">.</span> They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one<span class="highlight">'</span>s writing with them that is not really interrupt one<span class="highlight">'</span>s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one<span class="highlight">'</span>s writing <span class="highlight">, and</span> so<span class="highlight">,</span> they could be used and you could use them <span class="highlight">Periods (.)</span> could come to exist in this way <span class="highlight">, and</span> they could come in this way to have a life of their own.

          You can see what an <span class="highlight">'entirely different thing'</span> a <span class="highlight">period (.)</span> is from a <span class="highlight">comma (,),</span> a <span class="highlight">colon (:)</span> or a <span class="highlight">semi-colon (;).</span>

          There are <span class="highlight">two different way</span> of thinking about <span class="highlight">colons (:) & semicolons (;)</span> you can think of them as <span class="highlight">commas (,) , and</span> as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as <span class="highlight">periods (.) , and</span> then using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as <span class="highlight">periods (.)</span> but I myself never have<span class="highlight">,</span> I began unfortunately to feel them as <span class="highlight">a comma (.) , and</span> <span class="highlight">'commas'</span> are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience <span class="highlight">, and</span> they are put there just for practical purposes<span class="highlight">.</span> <span class="highlight">Semi-colons (;) & colons (:)</span> had for me from the first completely this character the character that a <span class="highlight">comma (,)</span> has and not the character that a <span class="highlight">period (.)</span> has and therefore and definitely I have never used them<span class="highlight">.</span> But now <span class="highlight">'dimly' , and 'definitely'</span> I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the <span class="highlight">period (.)</span> and so it might have been an adventure to use them<span class="highlight">.</span> I really do not think so<span class="highlight">.</span> I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more <span class="highlight">comma (,)</span> than <span class="highlight">period (.) , and</span> so really I cannot regret not having used them<span class="highlight">.</span> They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a <span class="highlight">comma (,)</span> but they are a <span class="highlight">comma (.)</span> all the same<span class="highlight">.</span> They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the <span class="highlight">comma (.)</span> nature<span class="highlight">.</span> And now what does a <span class="highlight">comma (.)</span> do <span class="highlight">, and</span> what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them<span class="highlight">.</span>
