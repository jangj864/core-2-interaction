         &nbsp;
         There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not<span class="highlight">.</span>
         <br>
         <br>         
         Let us begin with the punctuations that are not<span class="highlight">.</span>
         <br>
         <br>
         Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most <span class="highlight">uninteresting</span> is the <span class="highlight">question mark.</span>
         <br>
         <br>
         The <span class="highlight">question mark</span> is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely <span class="highlight">uninteresting.</span>
         <br>
         <br>
         It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing<span class="highlight">.</span>
         <br>
         <br>
        Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the <span class="highlight">question mark.</span> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun<span class="highlight">,</span> just an unnecessary name of something<span class="highlight">.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        A question is a question<span class="highlight">,</span> anyone can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the <span class="highlight">question mark</span> when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing<span class="highlight">.</span> Therefore I never could bring myself to use a <span class="highlight">question mark,</span> I always found it positively revolting<span class="highlight">,</span> and now very few do use it<span class="highlight">.</span>
         <br>
         <br>
         <b><span class="highlight">Exclamation marks</span></b>
        Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also <span class="highlight">quotation marks,
        <br>
        <br>&nbsp;
        </span> they are <b><span class="highlight">unnecessary, </span></b>
        <br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        they are <b><span class="highlight">ugly,</span></b>
        <br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        they<b><span class="highlight"> spoil</span></b> the line of the writing or the printing
        <br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        and anyway what is the use<span class="highlight">,</span>
        <br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        if you do not know that a question is a question 
        <br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        
        what is the use of its being a question<span class="highlight">.</span>
        <br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
        The same thing is true of a quotation<span class="highlight">.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use <span class="highlight">question marks</span> and <span class="highlight">quotation marks</span> and <span class="highlight">exclamation points</span> and now anyone sees it that way<span class="highlight">.
        <br>
        <br>
        </span> Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way<span class="highlight">.</span>
        </p>
      </section>
      <br>
      <br>

      <section class="Part" id="PartTwo">
        <p>&nbsp;
          So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious<span class="highlight">,</span> and so we do not have to go any farther into that<span class="highlight">.
            <br>
            <br>
          </span>  There are besides <span class="highlight">dashes</span> and <span class="highlight">dots</span><span class="highlight">,</span> and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting<span class="highlight">.</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>
            They might if one felt that way about them<span class="highlight">.</span>

      <section class="Part" id="PartThree">
        <p>&nbsp;
          One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the <span class="highlight">apostrophe</span> for possession<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Well feel as you like about that<span class="highlight">,</span> I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case <span class="highlight">apostrophe</span> has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          One does do without it<span class="highlight">,
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;
          </span> I do<span class="highlight">,</span> 
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          I mostly always do<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          but I cannot deny 
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          that from time to time I feel myself having regrets 
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in<span class="highlight">.</span>

          Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are <span class="highlight">colons</span> and <span class="highlight">semi-colons,</span> one might add to these <span class="highlight">commas.</span>

      <section class="Part" id="PartSeven">
        <p>&nbsp;
          When I first began writing<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          I felt that writing should go on<span class="highlight">,</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on
          <br>
          <br>
          and if writing should go on what had <span class="highlight">colons</span> and <span class="highlight">commas</span> to do with it<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          what had <span class="highlight">periods</span> to do with it what had <span class="highlight">small letters</span> and <span class="highlight">capitals</span> to do with it
          <br>
          <br>
          to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing.
          <br>
          <br>
          What had <span class="highlight">colons</span> and <span class="highlight">semi-colons</span> to do with it
          <br>
          <br>
          what had <span class="highlight">commas</span> to do with it what had <span class="highlight">periods</span> to do with it<span class="highlight">.</span>

          <br>
          Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          physically one had to again and again stop sometime
          <br>
          <br>
           and if one had to again and again stop sometime
           <br>

           <br>

           then <span class="highlight">periods</span> had to exist<span class="highlight">.</span>
           <br>
           <br>
           Beside I had always like the look of <span class="highlight">periods</span>
           <br>
           <br>
           and I liked what they did<span class="highlight">.</span>
           <br>
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on<span class="highlight">,</span>
           <br>
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           it was nothing that interfered<span class="highlight">,</span>

           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

           <br>
           <br>
           I did not believe in <span class="highlight">periods</span> and I used them<span class="highlight">.

            <br>

          <br>
          <br>
           that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way<span class="highlight">,</span> later I will read you a little of it<span class="highlight">.</span>

           <br>
           <br>
           that is not really interrupt one<span class="highlight">'</span>s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing 
           <br>
           <br>
           and so they could be used and you could use them<span class="highlight">.</span>

           <br>
           They did not serve you in any servile way as

        you can think of them as <span class="highlight">commas</span> and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as <span class="highlight">periods</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        and then using them can make you feel adventurous 
        <br>
        <br>
        I can see that one might feel about them as periods 
        <br>
        <br>
        but I myself never have<span class="highlight">,</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I began unfortunately to feel them as a 
        <span class="highlight">comma</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        and <span class="highlight">commas</span> are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="highlight">Semi-colons</span> and <span class="highlight">colons</span> had for me from the first completely this character the character 
        <br>
        <br>
        that a <span class="highlight">comma</span> has and not the character that a <span class="highlight">period</span> has and therefore and definitely I have never used them<span class="highlight">.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the <span class="highlight">period</span> and so it might have been an adventure to use them<span class="highlight">.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I really do not think so<span class="highlight">.        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
           I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more <span class="highlight">comma</span> than <span class="highlight">period</span>
           <br>
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          and so really I cannot regret not having used them<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a <span class="highlight">comma</span>
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          but they are a <span class="highlight">comma</span> all the same<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the <span class="highlight">comma</span> nature<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          And now what does a <span class="highlight">comma</span> do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them<span class="highlight">.</span>

          As I say <span class="highlight">comma</span> are servile and they have no life of their own<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          and their use is not a use<span class="highlight">,</span> it is a way of replacing one<span class="highlight">'</span>s own interest

          <br>
          and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in

          A <span class="highlight">comma</span> by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them<span class="highlight">,</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          the use of them was positively degrading<span class="highlight">.</span>

          When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans<span class="highlight">,</span> verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me<span class="highlight">.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing<span class="highlight">.</span>

          Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses<span class="highlight">.</span> I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence<span class="highlight">.</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that <span class="highlight">commas</span> would be degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity<span class="highlight">.</span> 
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity<span class="highlight">?</span>

          Do you see now why I feel about

          When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot<span class="highlight">,</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread<span class="highlight">,</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written<span class="highlight">.</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          And what does a <span class="highlight">comma</span> do<span class="highlight">,</span> a <span class="highlight">comma</span> does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the <span class="highlight">comma.</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you<span class="highlight">,</span> make you know yourself knowing it and the <span class="highlight">comma,</span> well at the most a <span class="highlight">comma</span> is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. 
          <br>
          <br>
          It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on<span class="highlight">,</span> but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath<span class="highlight">.</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly<span class="highlight">.</span> 
          <br>
          <br>
          And so I almost never used a <span class="highlight">comma.</span> The longer<span class="highlight">,</span> the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another<span class="highlight">,</span> the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them<span class="highlight">,</span> and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a <span class="highlight">comma.</span>
