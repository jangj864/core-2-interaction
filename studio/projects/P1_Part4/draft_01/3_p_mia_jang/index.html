          When I first began writing<span class="highlight">..</span> I felt that writing should go on<span class="highlight">..</span>  I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had <span class="highlight">colons..</span> and <span class="highlight">commas..</span> to do with <span class="highlight">it..</span> what had periods to do with it what had <span class="highlight">small letters..</span> and <span class="highlight">capitals..</span> to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing.

          You can see what an entirely different <span class="highlight">thing..</span> a <span class="highlight">period..</span> is from a <span class="highlight">comma..</span> a <span class="highlight">colon..</span> or a <span class="highlight">semi-colon..!</span>
