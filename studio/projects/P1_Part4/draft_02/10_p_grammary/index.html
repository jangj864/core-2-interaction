          <span class="highlight"><del>There are some punctuations that are</del> Some punctuations are </span>interesting and there are some punctuations that are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. Of these the one but the first and the most <span class="highlight"><del>the completely</del></span> <span class="highlight"><del>uninteresting</del></span> is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is evident that <span class="highlight"><del>is</del> if</span> you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you <span class="highlight"><del>therefore</del></span> wherefore should <span class="highlight">one<del></del></span> use the <span class="highlight"><del>question mark.</del> question mark?</span> <span class="highlight"><del>Beside</del> Besides</span> it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question <span class="highlight"><del>and</del></span> so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the <span class="highlight"><del>writing.</del> writing?</span> Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing <span class="highlight"><del>and</del></span> <span class="highlight"><del>anyway</del> anyway,</span> what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps <span class="highlight"><del>some day</del>someday</span> they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.

          So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting <span class="highlight"><del>in a way that is perfectly obvious,</del> a perfectly obvious way,</span> and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are <span class="highlight"><del>besides</del></span> dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them.

          One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession. Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for <span class="highlight"><del>some</del></span> the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to <span class="highlight"><del>definitely</del></span> decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do,<span class="highlight"> and</span> I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put <span class="highlight"><del>it</del> them</span> in to make the possessive case. I <span class="highlight"><del>absolutely</del></span> do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, <span class="highlight"><del>there</del></span> it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word <span class="highlight">,</span> and <span class="highlight"><del>its s</del> it is</span> well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to <span class="highlight"><del>time</del> time,</span> I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny <span class="highlight"><del>but</del></span> that I do from time to time let it come in.

          So now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, commas, colons, semi-colons <span class="highlight"><del>and</del></span> capitals <span class="highlight"><del>and</del> , and</span> small letters.

          When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, what had periods to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons to do with it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with <span class="highlight"><del>it.</del> it?</span>

      <section class="Part" id="PartEight">
        <p>
          What had periods to do with <span class="highlight"><del>it.</del> it?</span> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop sometime <span class="highlight"><del>and</del> , and</span> if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist. <span class="highlight"><del>Beside</del> Besides</span> I had always <span class="highlight"><del>like</del> liked</span> the look of periods and I liked what they did. Stopping <span class="highlight"><del>sometime</del> sometimes</span> did not really <span class="highlight"><del>really</del></span> one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I <span class="highlight"><del>really</del></span> never stopped using them.

      <section class="Part" id="PartNine">
        <p>
          <span class="highlight"><del>Beside</del> Besides</span> that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, <span class="highlight"><del>that</del> which</span> has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years <span class="highlight"><del>ago</del> ago,</span> periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own. They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not <span class="highlight"><del>really</del></span> <span class="highlight"><del>interrupt</del> interrupting</span> one’s writing with them but one could come to <span class="highlight"><del>stop</del></span> arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do. <span class="highlight"><del>Yes</del> Yes,</span> you do feel what I mean.

          Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own. And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety <span class="highlight"><del>that</del></span> is the reason that I have always remained true to periods so much so that as I <span class="highlight"><del>say</del> said</span> recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.

          You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon <span class="highlight"><del>or</del> , or</span> a semi-colon.

      </section>
      <section class="Part" id="PartTwelve">
        <p>
          There are two different <span class="highlight"><del>way</del> ways</span> of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I <span class="highlight"><del>myself</del></span> never have, I <span class="highlight"><del>began</del> began,</span> <span class="highlight"><del>unfortunately</del> unfortunately,</span> to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first <span class="highlight"><del>completely</del> complete</span> this character <span class="highlight"><del>the</del> is</span> character that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and <span class="highlight"><del>definitely</del></span> I have never used them. But now dimly and <span class="highlight"><del>definitely</del></span> I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the period and so it might have been an adventure to use them. I <span class="highlight"><del>really</del></span> do not think so. I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. They <span class="highlight"><del>really</del></span> have within them deeply within them fundamentally <span class="highlight"><del>within them</del></span> the comma nature. And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about <span class="highlight"><del>them.</del> them?</span>

          As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s <span class="highlight"><del>own</del></span> interest and I do decidedly like to like my <span class="highlight"><del>own</del></span> interest my <span class="highlight"><del>own</del></span> interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it <span class="highlight"><del>and</del></span> to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel <span class="highlight"><del>and</del></span> what I mean and what I felt <span class="highlight"><del>and</del></span> what I meant.

          When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.

          Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses. I <span class="highlight"><del>have</del></span> like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that <span class="highlight"><del>simplicity.</del> simplicity?</span> Do you see now why I feel about that <span class="highlight"><del>simplicity.</del> simplicity?</span> Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I <span class="highlight"><del>do.</del> do?</span>

          When it gets really difficult you want <span class="highlight"><del>to</del></span> disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least <span class="highlight"><del>of</del></span> anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody <span class="highlight"><del>feels</del></span> who is working with any tool so anybody <span class="highlight"><del>feels</del></span> who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make <span class="highlight"><del>easy</del></span> a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it <span class="highlight"><del>and</del> , and</span> the comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another <span class="highlight"><del>breath.</del> breath?</span> <span class="highlight"><del>Anyway</del> Anyway,</span> that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I <span class="highlight"><del>almost never</del> rarely</span> used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need <span class="highlight"><del>of</del> for</span> <span class="highlight"><del>their</del> them</span> <span class="highlight"><del>taking</del> to take</span> care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.

          So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in <span class="highlight"><del>poetry</del> poetry,</span> it is a little different but more <span class="highlight"><del>so</del> so,</span> and later I will go into that. But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.
