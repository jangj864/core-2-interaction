         There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not<span class="highlight">...</span> Let us begin with the punctuations that are not<span class="highlight">...</span> Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark<span class="highlight">..!</span> The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely<span class="highlight">..</span> entirely<span class="highlight">..</span> completely<span class="highlight">..</span> uninteresting<span class="highlight">...</span> It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing<span class="highlight">...</span> Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark<span class="highlight">..?</span> Besides<span class="highlight">..</span> it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun<span class="highlight">..</span> just an unnecessary name of something<span class="highlight">...</span> A question is a question<span class="highlight">..</span> anyone can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing<span class="highlight">...</span> Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it<span class="highlight">...</span> Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks<span class="highlight">..</span> they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use<span class="highlight">..</span> if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question<span class="highlight">...</span> The same thing is true of a quotation<span class="highlight">...</span> When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks<span class="highlight">..</span> and quotation marks<span class="highlight">..</span> and exclamation points<span class="highlight"></span>..</span> and now anyone sees it that way<span class="highlight">...</span> Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way<span class="highlight">..!</span>

          So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious<span class="highlight">..</span> and so we do not have to go any farther into that<span class="highlight">...</span>  There are besides dashes<span class="highlight">..</span> and dots<span class="highlight">..</span> and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting<span class="highlight">...</span>  They might if one felt that way about them<span class="highlight">...</span>

          One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe<span class="highlight">..</span> for possession<span class="highlight">...</span> Well<span class="highlight">..</span> feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it<span class="highlight">...</span> One does do without it<span class="highlight">..</span> I do<span class="highlight">..</span> I mostly always do<span class="highlight">..</span> but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case<span class="highlight">...</span> I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness<span class="highlight">...</span> At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in<span class="highlight">...</span> I cannot positively deny<span class="highlight">..</span>but that I do from time to time let it come in<span class="highlight">...</span>

          When I first began writing<span class="highlight">..</span> I felt that writing should go on<span class="highlight">..</span>  I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons<span class="highlight">..</span> and commas<span class="highlight">..</span> to do with it<span class="highlight">..</span> what had periods to do with it what had small letters<span class="highlight">..</span> and capitals<span class="highlight">..</span> to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing.

          What had periods to do with it<span class="highlight">..?</span> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on<span class="highlight">..</span> physically one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist<span class="highlight">...</span> Beside I had always like the look of periods<span class="highlight">..</span> and I liked what they did<span class="highlight">...</span> Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on<span class="highlight">...</span> it was nothing that interfered<span class="highlight">...</span> it was only something that happened<span class="highlight">...</span> and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening<span class="highlight">...</span> I did not believe in periods<span class="highlight">..</span> and I used them<span class="highlight">..!</span> I really never stopped using them<span class="highlight">..!</span>

          You can see what an entirely different thing<span class="highlight">..</span> a period<span class="highlight">..</span> is from a comma<span class="highlight">..</span> a colon<span class="highlight">..</span> or a semi-colon<span class="highlight">..!</span>

          There are two different way of thinking about colons<span class="highlight">..</span> and semicolons<span class="highlight">..</span> you can think of them as commas<span class="highlight">..</span> and as such they are purely servile<span class="highlight">..</span> or you can think of them as periods<span class="highlight">..</span> and then using them can make you feel adventurous<span class="highlight">..</span> I can see that one might feel about them<span class="highlight">..</span> as periods but I myself never have<span class="highlight">..</span> I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma<span class="highlight">..</span> and commas<span class="highlight">..</span> are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes<span class="highlight">...</span> Semi-colons<span class="highlight">..</span> and colons<span class="highlight">..</span> had for me from the first completely this character<span class="highlight">..</span> the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them<span class="highlight">...</span> But now<span class="highlight">..</span> dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them<span class="highlight">..</span> something of the character of the period<span class="highlight">..</span> and so it might have been an adventure to use them<span class="highlight">...</span> I really do not think so<span class="highlight">...</span> I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period<span class="highlight">..</span> and so really I cannot regret not having used them<span class="highlight">...</span> They are more powerful<span class="highlight">..</span> more imposing<span class="highlight">..</span> more pretentious<span class="highlight">..</span> than a comma<span class="highlight">..</span> but they are a comma<span class="highlight">..</span> all the same<span class="highlight">...</span> They really have within them deeply<span class="highlight">..</span> within them fundamentally<span class="highlight">..</span> within them the comma nature<span class="highlight">...</span> And now<span class="highlight">..</span> what does a comma do<span class="highlight">..</span> and what has it to do<span class="highlight">..</span> and why do I feel as I do<span class="highlight">..</span> about them<span class="highlight">..?</span>
