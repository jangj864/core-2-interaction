            <h1>Event Details</h1>
            <h2>Join us for a transformative Earth Month event highlighting the results and recommendations from an 18-month study to understand future climate change in New York City, commissioned by the NYC Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice and Department of Citywide Administrative Services called the “Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA).”  The study explores how current and emerging hazards such as flooding, sea level rise, and extreme heat pose substantial challenges to the city’s infrastructure and communities. Learn more about this interdisciplinary effort bringing together expertise in academia, government, and the private sector, co-led by Professors Timon McPhearson and Joel Towers at The New School in partnership with NYC Interagency Collaborators. The results of the study will be used to inform development of the NYC Panel on Climate Change’s 4th Assessment.</h2>

                <h1>Focus on four key areas</h1>
                <h2>
                    1. Climate risk projections and compound or sequential hazards
                    <br>
                    2. Climate-related extreme heavy rainfall projections
                    <br>
                    3. The economic and health implications of climate change in NYC
                    <br>
                    4. Development of a flood vulnerability index
                </h2>

            <h6>Join members of the VIA team as well as representatives from the Mayor's Office as they discuss the importance of this work to secure a resilient and sustainable future for New York City.

                <h2>
                    The New School campus is wheelchair accessible and has elevator access to all floors. Service animals and assistive devices are welcome. If you have specific accommodation questions or needs, please contact us at least five days prior to the program at tedc@newschool.edu.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Masks are strongly recommended in indoor public settings on the campus, particularly in classrooms and other crowded indoor spaces. As we gather again after breaks, masks help mitigate increased risk for respiratory illnesses including COVID-19, flu, and RSV.
