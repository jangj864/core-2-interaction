        <h3>Join us for a transformative Earth Month event highlighting the results and recommendations from an 18-month study to understand future climate change in New York City, commissioned by the NYC Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice and Department of Citywide Administrative Services called the "Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA)."  The study explores how current and emerging hazards such as flooding, sea level rise, and extreme heat pose substantial challenges to the city's infrastructure and communities. Learn more about this interdisciplinary effort bringing together expertise in academia, government, and the private sector, co-led by Professors Timon McPhearson and Joel Towers at The New School in partnership with NYC Interagency Collaborators. The results of the study will be used to inform development of the NYC Panel on Climate Change’s 4th Assessment.</h4>

        <h4>Focus on four key areas</h4>
        <h5>1. Climate risk projections and compound or sequential hazards
            <br>
            2. Climate-related extreme heavy rainfall projections
            <br>            
            3. The economic and health implications of climate change in NYC
            <br>        
            4. Development of a flood vulnerability index</h5>
